# Classification of handwritten digits in the MNIST dataset

This is a practice project I undertook to enhance my skills in handling basic data and understanding the basic outline of developing a Machine Learning solution. This is also where I took off some of the "training wheels" provided by the `fastai` library to look at the corresponding `PyTorch`/raw implementation. I have a created a blog explaining the entire process. Check it out [here](https://suchitg04.github.io/blog/posts/mnist).

`mnist1.ipynb` classifies only `3` and `7`

`mnist2.ipynb` classifies all 10 digits of the entire MNIST dataset (60k images)

The requirements/dependencies have been put up in `requirements.txt`.
